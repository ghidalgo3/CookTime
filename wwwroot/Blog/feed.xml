Get ready!</p>

<h1 id="new-recipes">New recipes</h1>
<p>Any recipe created in the last week will be shown in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Recipes</code> list of the home page.
Usually these recipes are “in-development” so showing them first makes the author’s job easier.</p>

<h1 id="feature-recipes">Feature recipes</h1>
<p>For the featured recipes lists, we query our recipe database for recipes with photos, take <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> of them, and then display them on the page.
It is preferable to ask the database to randomly sort and take the top <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> recipes after sorting, otherwise we have to load all the recipes client-side, randomize, and take <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> of them.
This can take an unnacceptable amount of time if the number of recipes is large.
CookTime uses PostgreSQL as its database, Entity Framework as the ORM, and the npsql as the bridge between LINQ queries and PostgreSQL statements. 
PostgreSQL can certainl do what we want, I found a stack overflow question asking for exactly this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/654906/linq-to-entities-random-order</p>

<p>The only missing piece was to enable an extension on the database to allow it to generate UUIDs on-demand to create random sort orders. The query-command is this:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";</code></p>

<p>With all that database infrastructure in place, we now show featured recipes on the home page :).</p>

<h1 id="pagination">Pagination</h1>
<p>The home page and query results are now paginated.
This should reduce the amount of scrolling needed on mobile devices to view recipes.
We observed that users get lost if the page is too long to scroll through; pages should address this issue.</p>

<h1 id="ratings-and-reviews">Ratings and Reviews</h1>
<p>If you have a CookTime account, you can now rate and review recipes.
Your ratings will be aggregated and averaged.
Over time, we will come to find which recipes are the best recipes :)</p>

<h1 id="authentication-improvements">Authentication improvements</h1>
<p>You can now use your email OR your username to sign in to CookTime.
We now also display validation errors during the sign up process.
We have simplified the password requirements, basically you need atleast 2 unique characters and a minimum length of 6 total characters.</p>

<h1 id="categories-in-the-navigation-bar">Categories in the navigation bar</h1>
<p>During user testing, we found that users wanted to know what were all of the categories of reicpes that CookTime had recipes for.
We did not have a way to view the list of categories, but now we do!
You can click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Categories</code> in the navigation bar and then click on a category you’re interested in to view all recieps for that category.</p>

<h1 id="ingredient-aliases">Ingredient aliases</h1>
<p>This feature is not user-facing but it did involve a big change in our backend so I’d like to describe it.</p>

<p>Early in CookTime’s development we identified a need for ingredient aliases.
For example, “milk” and “whole milk” are practically the same ingredient, so for the purposes of auto-completion and building a correct recipe database we should treat them as the same ingredient.
Initially this was <em>not</em> the case, recipes with “milk” and “whole milk” would be referencing unique ingredients and this would create several kinds of problems for us.</p>

<p>We could not associate different variants of an ingredient name with unique nutrition facts.</p>

<p>We could not properly highlight ingredient names in the recipe text if the user used one name in the ingredients list but another name in the text.
This is extremely common: for example you might say a recipe need 6 galic cloves but then in the text of the recipe you will write “peel the garlic.”
Since you did not write exactly “garlic clove”, we would not highlight the ingredient and thats not a good user experience.</p>

<p>Another problem was that we have a power user that creates recipes in portuguese so we had to associate the portuguese words for milk if we wanted nutrition facts and all the other features to work.</p>

<p>To implement aliases, we basically store a list of names for an ingredient along with a single “canonical” name.
In the case of milk, this looks like:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Milk; Leite; Whole Milk</code>
Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Milk</code> is the canonical name, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Leite</code> (milk in portugues) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Whole Milk</code> are aliases for this ingredient.</p>

<p>The bulk of the work of this change was to hide from the user the fact that an ingredient’s name is now a semi-colon separated list of possible aliases.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost 2 weeks without a blog post, lots of things have gotten done.

<p>Now CookTime will automatically show you mass and volume for all ingredients. The conversion is very simple: if we know the density of the ingredient based on the USDA dataset, we will show you the opposite unit in SI unit. For example, 1 cup of milk will <em>also</em> be shown as 244g.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever had a recipe measure an ingredient by mass, but you don’t have a scale?

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hi HN,

COVID lockdowns made me and my wife cook a lot more at home, and we had a need to streamline our recipe management woes. These were some of the problems we identified:

  - Most recipe websites are what I call "mommy blogs", and the principal problem is that the recipe ingredient list and instructions are buried in a SEO-laden essay that we don't care about. We were sharing links to our favorite recipes, but links don't allow you to skip past the unnecessary essay prefacing the recipe. We knew we wanted a way to have recipes uncompromised by unrelated essays.
  - Popular recipe aggregating websites are run by publishing companies that do not want you, the reader, to contribute your own recipes. This is not true for all of them; Allrecipes.com does allow you to enter recipes but that UI leaves a lot to be desired. We knew we needed a way for us (and you) to write your own recipes.
  - Most recipe websites do not allow you to scale recipe ingredients. We like to cook a lot at once, and we don't like to keep track of a 2x, or 3x multiplier in our heads while cooking. We knew we wanted a simple way of scaling ingredients.
  - Most recipe websites do not contain adequate nutrition information about their recipes. When they do, they don't show their math, or their sources. We knew we needed an automatic nutrition calculation for recipes based on ingredients and their quantities.

After a few months of nights and weekends, we are ready to share https://letscooktime.com . We solved all of the primary problems listed above, and more! Our features:

  - Recipe creation: You can write your own recipes on CookTime, and share them with the world. 
  - Ingredient highlights: CookTime will highlight ingredients by name in the recipe's instructions, and if you click or tap on them we will show you the quantity needed. This becomes important when you're following a recipe on a phone because it saves you having to scroll back and forth between ingredient manifests and recipe text. 
  - Recipe components: Most recipes are simple enough to not need this feature, but some recipes are complex in a specific way: the same ingredient is used multiple times in different quantities. This seems to be more common in baking recipes; you may use flour or sugar in different components (like a pie crust vs. a filling) at different times with different quantities. 
  - Automatic nutrition calculation: CookTime contains the full dataset of the USDA Legacy Standard Reference nutrition dataset and part of the Branded Foods dataset. We associate ingredients with their corresponding entry in the dataset, scale based on mass, volume, or quantity, and then use that to compute nutrition facts for a recipe. Some ingredients may not have an association, and in that case we can fix that by editing the database directly (work in progress to improve this :)) 
  - Grocery lists: You can add recipes to a grocery list, and if they have overlapping ingredients CookTime will simply add them up and show you a unified view of the groceries you need to buy.
  - Scaling recipes: Nothing much to say here, it works.
  - Tagging: The tagging system internally is generic enough, but we are currently limiting the set of allowed tags. Needless to say, you can tag recipes.
  - No blogging, just recipes! No bullshit essay to scroll through.

We think the closest thing to CookTime is https://www.paprikaapp.com. Paprika is a paid native app, CookTime is a free mobile-ready website you can try _today_. I do not believe that recipe management really requires the performance, development cost, and App Store cost of a native app. 

Without a CookTime account, you can:

  - Browse recipes 
  - Read their nutrition facts
  - Scale ingredients temporarily
  - Share links to recipes

With a CookTime account, you can:

  - Add your own recipes
  - Add recipes to your personal groceries list

Let me know what you think! Would you use it? What are you currently using to track your recipes? What missing feature is stopping you from using CookTime?
