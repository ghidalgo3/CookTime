Now that CookTime supports user accounts, it is possible to assign ownership of recipes to specific users.
As of today, recipes will now have an "owner", and only the owner will be allowed to edit or delete the recipe.
All existing recipes will be assigned to either Camila or Gustavo for ownership, depending on who likes the recipe the most.
