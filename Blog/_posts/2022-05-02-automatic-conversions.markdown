Have you ever had a recipe measure an ingredient by mass, but you don't have a scale? Or the opposite sitation: a recipe that measures by volume but you don't have a measuring cup.

Now CookTime will automatically show you mass and volume for all ingredients. The conversion is very simple: if we know the density of the ingredient based on the USDA dataset, we will show you the opposite unit in SI unit. For example, 1 cup of milk will _also_ be shown as 244g.
