## Ingredients

- 2 onions
- 6 garlic cloves

## Directions
#. Peel and dice the onions. Peel and mince the garlic. Drain the kidney beans.
#. Place a large pot over medium-high heat with 3 Tbsp vegetable oil. Add the diced onion, minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until softened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the walnuts, chili seasoning, and oregano and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
