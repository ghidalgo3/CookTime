## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup quinoa
- 12 oz cauliflower florets
- 8 garlic cloves
- 2 shallots
- 1/2 cup cashews
- 29 oz fire-roasted diced tomatoes (or 2 cans with ~14.5 oz each)
- 11 oz coconut milk (or 1 can with ~13 oz each)
- 4 Tbsp Parmesan cheese (vegan cheese, if available)

## Directions
#. Preheat oven to 400F. Add the quinoa, 1 cup of water, and a pinch of salt to a small sauce pan over high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and cook until the spirals burst and all of the water is absorbed, about 10 to 12 minutes.
#. Transfer the cauliflower florets to a baking sheet and toss with 1 Tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast until tender and browned in places, about 12 to 15 minutes.
#. Peel and roughly chop the garlic and shallot. Place a large pot over medium heat with 2 Tbsp olive oil. Once hot, add the chopped garlic and chopped shallot and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 3 to 5 minutes.
#. Add the cashews, tomatoes, coconut milk, and 1/2 cup water to the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully pour the bisque into the blender and puree until smooth. Taste and season the tomato bisque with salt and pepper. 
#. Toss the roasted cauliflower with Parmesan. Divide the creamy tomato bisque between large bowls. Top with quinoa and cauliflower.
