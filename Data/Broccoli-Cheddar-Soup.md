## Ingredients

- 2 russet potatoes
- 20 oz broccoli florets
- 2 bread rolls
- 6 garlic cloves
- 6 Tbsp vegan butter
- 2 Tbsp white miso paste
- 2 onions
- 4 Tbsp nutriotional yeast
- 4 tsp vegetable broth concentrate

## Directions
#. Preheat over to 425F. Peel and dice the potato. Roughly chop the broccoli florets into bite-size pieces. Add just 1 cup diced potato to a large pot, cover with 1 inch of water, and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and add just 4 cups chopped broccoli florets. Cover and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer vegetables to a blender.
#. Add remaining diced potato and remaining chopped broccoli florets to a baking sheet and toss with 2 Tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast until tender, about 15 to 17 minutes.
#. Cut the bread roll into 1/2 inch cubes. Peel and mince the garlic. Add the butter, white miso paste, and just half the minced garlic to a bowl and mix well. Add the cubed bread to a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes.
#. Peel and dice the onion. Place a medium skillet over medium-high heat with 2 Tbsp olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the diced onion and remaining minced garlic. Cook until softened, about 3 to 5 minutes, and transfer to the blender with the boiled potatoes and broccoli.
#. Add the nutritional yeast, vegetable broth concentrate, 2 cups water, 2 tsp salt, and a pinch of pepper to the blender. Blend the broccoli cheddar soup until smooth, making sure to vent the blender for steam to escape. If necessary, blend the soup in batches, don't overfill the blender.
#. Divide the soup between bowls, top with roasted potatoes, roasted broccoli, and miso garlic croutons.
