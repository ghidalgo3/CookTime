## Ingredients

- 18 oz broccolini
- 6 garlic cloves
- 4 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp sage, dried
- 2 1/4 cups walnut
- 6 oz baby spinach
- 3/4 cup vegan Parmesan
- 16 oz chickpea penne

## Directions
#. Preheat oven to 425°F.
#. Bring large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta. Trim the bottom inch off the broccolini stems and add the stalks to a baking sheet. Toss with 2 tbsp olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast until tender, about 10 minutes.
#. Peel the garlic. In a food processor, combine the garlic, lemon juice, sage, walnuts, spinach, Parmesan, 2/3 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup water, 1 tsp salt, and a pinch of pepper. Pulse pesto until well combined but not completely smooth.
#. Once the water is boiling, add the penne, stir, and cook until al dent, about 7 minutes. Reserve 3/4 cup of pasta water and drain the penne. Return the penne to the pot, off of the heat.
#. Add the pest and reserved past water to the penne in the pot. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until penne is well coated and pesto sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Season pasta to taste with salt.
#. Serve pasta with crispy broccolini.
