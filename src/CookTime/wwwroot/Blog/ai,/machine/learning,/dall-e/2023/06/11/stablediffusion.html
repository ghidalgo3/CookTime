    <p>We know that most users browse for recipes with their eyes, so having good images is important.
Camila and I quickly learned that food photography is very difficult, so we were looking for a way to save time and avoid copyright infringement.
Earlier this year, we started using AI to generate images for CookTime recipes.
It was very simple, we simply followed the guide laid out <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion">here</a>.
The one quirky thing was that we had to run this on the single machine at home with 8GB of GPU memory which was a gaming laptop.
After that, we did some prompt engineering using the recipe titles and put some AI generated images on CookTime.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://letscooktime.com/Recipes/Details?id=af5a0f90-a348-439a-bd5a-752b434ed081">Beef wellington</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://letscooktime.com/Recipes/Details?id=7ff14788-5680-41cf-8aec-dbfff22a6d02">Baklava overnight oats</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://letscooktime.com/Recipes/Details?id=f2e05068-83e0-450a-bce9-ff8ed9146861">Beet pancakes</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Pretty cool!</p>
