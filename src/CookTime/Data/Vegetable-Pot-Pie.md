## Ingredients

- 2 pie crusts, thawed
- 10oz extra firm tofu
- 20oz frozen bag of onion, celery, and carrot mix
- 1/2 cup fresh or frozen peas
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 Russet or red gold potato, diced
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons nutritional yeast
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 1/4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped sage
- 1 teaspoon thyme leaves
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- Salt and pepper

## Directions
#. Preheat oven to 400° F.
#. Cut tofu into 1/3-inch dice and press between clean kitchen towels or paper towels to rid of excess water.
#. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook tofu until golden on all, or most, sides. Remove tofu from skillet and set aside.
#. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the same skillet. Add onion, celery, carrot, and garlic and sauté until onion is translucent.
#. Add potato to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until tender but not mushy.
#. Add flour, nutritional yeast, and soy sauce to the skillet and stir into the vegetables.
#. Add vegetable broth and stir until combined, scraping all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
#. Add tofu, peas, sage, and thyme and stir until combined.
#. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.
#. Prepare pie crust according to packaging instructions. Fill pie with tofu and vegetable mixture. Place dough over the filling to complete pot pie, press to seal around the edges of the dishes and crimp with a fork. Cut a slit in the middle.
#. Bake in the oven until golden, about 30 minutes.
