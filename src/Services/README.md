# Structure
1. Interfaces: Pretty self-explanatory. Interfaces for _cooktime_ go here.
1. Shared: Long-term I need to extract this into a re-usable library that I can take with me from project to project, but basically these classes should be very fundamental to any SaaS application.
1. Implementations: Implementations of interfaces for _cooktime_ only.
