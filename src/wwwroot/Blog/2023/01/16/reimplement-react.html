    <p>Since the beginning, CookTime was mainly an ASP.NET Razor page application with a small amount of React, mainly for the very interactive recipe edit page.
This was fine for a while, but I’ve been using React more at work and I’ve decided that Razor pages, while good, lack the development maturity, mindshare, and interactivity of React. 
I’ve resolved to reimplement the CookTime UI as a React single page application (SPA) with these goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make frontend development interactive with Hot Module Reload (HMR)</li>
  <li>Create re-useable and testable frontend components</li>
  <li>Use proper DTOs instead of marshalling database objects between server and client (exploring using GraphQL for this?).</li>
</ol>

<p>This post will be a development diary of all the changes necessary to accomplish this goal.
Let’s dive in!</p>

<h1 id="day-1-getting-something-running">Day 1: Getting something running</h1>
<p>I’m going to use <a href="https://create-react-app.dev">create-react-app</a> to scaffold the initial state of the client app.
I did this by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npx create-react-app client-app --template typescript</code> at the root of the repo, which gets a React SPA set up in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">client-app</code> directory.</p>

<p>Next I need to integrate the frontend development server with the backend server.
This is required only for <em>development</em> though setting it up is a little tedious and confusing so I’ll try my best to explain it to future me.
In production, the ASP.NET server would be serving the SPA as static pre-compiled HTML, JS, and CSS.
This is great because clients can cache resources to make page loads faster and server resources are mostly spent on serving REST calls instead of rendering HTML for the client.
However this means that if we want HMR, the ASP.NET server has to open and maintain a connection to browser clients and push changes to files as they are made.
This used to be the case with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions</code> and to configure it you would have to add startup code like this:</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Map</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="s">"/js"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ctx</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">ctx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">UseSpa</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">spa</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="n">spa</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">UseProxyToSpaDevelopmentServer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"http://localhost:8080/js"</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This tells ASP.NET that any call to a path starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/js</code> should be proxied to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:8080/js</code> where, hopefully, a second server is running listing for filesystem events to deliver the nice HMR experience.
In this case, ASP.NET is the <em>first</em> process that receives calls and decides to handle them or proxy them to another process.</p>

<p>The ASP.NET team decided they <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/17902">don’t want to maintain this anymore</a> citing “simplicity” arguments so we have to now invert which process handles the request first:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Before</em>:  ASP.NET sees the request first, if it matches a specific path (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/js</code>) the request is proxied to the React development server.</li>
  <li><em>After</em>: The React deveopment server sees the request first, if it matches a specific path (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api</code>) the request is proxied to the ASP.NET development server.</li>
</ol>

<p>Same result? Yes. Better? Probably not. Does it make the web development world harder by deprecating a working solution? Yes!</p>

<p>So we replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaProxy</code> and modify our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">csproj</code> file to tell it how to start the development server.
The full documentation for the new NuGet is <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/26373">here</a> and that page does a better job than me.</p>

<p>With all that done, the standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-react-app</code> page loads with the spinning Rutherfordian atom.</p>

<p>Success!

<h1 id="day-2-authentication-and-authorization">Day 2: Authentication and Authorization</h1>

<p>Before we get to the fun parts of re-writing the Razor pages as React components, we have to deal with the un-fun features of signing in and authorizing users.
Addressing this led me down a rabbit-hole of authentication acronymns and open-ended questioning whether or not you should be able to use your Google account to sign in.
In the end, I decided that CookTime will</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Continue</em> to be its own authentication and authorization provider.</li>
  <li><em>Continue</em> to use ASP.NET Identity cookies to identify users.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>alternative</em> of course would have been to</p>
<ol>
  <li>Delegate to an authentication provider (like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, etc…) and implement the correct <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OIDC</a> flow</li>
  <li>Configure <em>each</em> authentication provider and map claims appropriately so CookTime doesn’t care who provided the JWT.</li>
</ol>

<p>I simply do not have the patience or desire to setup OAuth authentication for CookTime and if this costs us users then so be it.
The whole process is mind-meltingly boring.</p>

<p>Having decided that, I need to reimplement the Identity flows using React components instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forms</code> for</p>
<ol>
  <li>Registration</li>
  <li>Sign in</li>
  <li>Sign out</li>
  <li>Password reset</li>
  <li>Email verification</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hoes-does-aspnet-authentication-actually-work">Hoes does ASP.NET authentication actually work?</h2>
<p>If you use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">cookie</a> authentication, the signin process just involves the server setting a cookie in a response.
<img src="/Blog/assets/images/react-day2-2.png" alt="Cookie signin evidence" /></p>

<p>Here’s what happened:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The client POSTs a signin form with the username and password</li>
  <li>The server responds with an OK <em>and</em> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.AspNetCore.Identity.Application</code> cookie.</li>
  <li>The browser stores the cookie and sends it to the server in all subsequent requests in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cookie</code> header.</li>
</ol>

<p>So how does the server authenticate the user and set the cookie? Something like this:</p>
<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="p">[</span><span class="nf">HttpPost</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"signin"</span><span class="p">)]</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An interesting feature of this particular cookie is that it has the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HttpOnly</code> flag set, which means that JavaScript code cannot access this cookie. Even if the client side code could access the cookie, it is encrypted by the server and it wouldn’t be feasible to decrypt it without leaking keys. Without access to a decrypted cookie, our client-side code does not have any actual information about the user. We don’t know their name, what roles they have, any other claims they may have, among others.</p>

<p>To solve this, we need an <em>authenticated</em> request to a route like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/profile</code> that basically exchanges a valid authentication cookie with a JWT-like object that contains important claims like the username, roles, claims, etc… So that’s what we will do.</p>

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
<p>The registration form is “simple” (Ha! Nothing with authentication is simple!).
A user providers the following information (taken from the current sign up form).</p>

<p><img src="/Blog/assets/images/react-day2-1.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>Then in the backend, we take this and check to see if a user with the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> <em>or</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">email</code> has previously been registered.
Assuming not, we try to create the user and if their password passes the complexity checks then they get a database entry in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AspNetUsers</code> table.
We also fire off an email to the email provided to validate that this is a real email!
It should be simple enough to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make a React form that accepts these 4 inputs</li>
  <li>POST the information to the server</li>
  <li>Create the user if needed</li>
</ol>

<p>… A few days later …
Indeed I did that and spent a few days in the refactoring jungles so now I will summarize some of the largest changes:</p>

<h1 id="introducing-react-router">Introducing react-router</h1>
<p>Now that we have a SPA, we have to be able to navigate between pages.
The most popular library for React to do this seems to be Remix’s <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main">react-router</a> so I’ve chosen to use it.
The library works like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">router</code> object that maps URLs to React component. Previously we relied on Razor page file organization conventions to match URL to Razor pages but now this is done explicitly by the router configuration.</li>
  <li>For each route you want to match, you define a React component that gets rendered at that route. These are the site “pages” different from reusable components.</li>
  <li>Replace all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">href</code>s with a combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">To</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Link</code> elements from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">react-router</code>. Normally, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">href</code>s make the browser navigate which is <em>verboten</em> for react-router. If you navigate, you are no longer a single-page application!</li>
</ol>

<p>Having understood react-router, the challenge here was actually rewriting every Razor page as a React page.
The UI side of this was really easy, the problem was that we were running a lot of Entity Framework queries in the backend that were never exposed as REST APIs.
For most of the pages I had to do something like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write the react components</li>
  <li>Expose a REST call equivalent to the DB query we were previously performing to render the Razor page</li>
  <li>Make the frontend call the query.</li>
</ol>

<p>Simple work but it was very laborious.</p>
